Here are some of my recent projects.


### NN by Hand
**Description**: This project implements a neural network from scratch in Python, showcasing forward and backward propagation using only NumPy. The project includes:
- A two-layer network for the MNIST dataset.
- Vectorized computations.
- Plots for loss and accuracy.

**Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib

**Highlights**:
- Developed custom functions for forward and backward propagation.
- Addressed overflow issues and improved numerical stability in activation functions.
- Visualized performance with a confusion matrix and learning curves.
